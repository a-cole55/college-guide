College Guide

College Guide is a passion project that encompasses the past decade of my life in higher education. As a college advisor, I have counseled countless students on how to navigate college to the point that I can recall this information in my sleep. As another way to give back to first-generation college students and spread my knowledge, I've decided to create a college guide with key points about college that I've learned over the years.

How It's Made:
Tech used: React, Framer Motion, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

This site initially began as a simple information web application to share college related information. After the information was added, I wanted to make it a more custom experience so I added the chat component. This will allow students to chat with me directly and ask questions about questions. Eventually I would like to add a login feature and maybe allow users to connect or allow students to track their progress in completing the required steps for getting into college.

Optimizations
I'm currently in the process of building out the chat component, which will allow students to chat with me directly to address additional, more personalized questions they may have. As site traffic picks up, I may integrate ChatEngine.io into this project to allow for a more seamless user experience (and convenience for me as a developer). ChatEngine.io streamlines the chat experience, sends email notifications of new chats, etc. Also, I may add a "networking" component for students to connect with one another or other higher ed professionals.

Lessons Learned:
On this project I learned the importance of Links in React. I like that it speeds up performance by not having to send an entire new http request. 




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
